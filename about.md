# Foods ðŸ¥˜ people from the US are most interested in.

While trying to improve my visualization skills, i thought to look at data on the US.   
I was able to get this data from kaggle and was interested in analyzing it because who doesn't love food?   

While analyzing the food i got to understand that a person's choice of food depends on so many things, from the environment and culture to monetary availability.   
Some people expressed interest in knowing about some cuisines and others said they already knew about cuisines.   
However, I got to learn that most people go for the mainstream dishes like Chinese while avoiding foreign dishes like Vietnamese.

But thats just my opinion feel free to draw yours ðŸ™‚ after looking through my thought process ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://lagom-qb.github.io/Food-World-Cup/)
